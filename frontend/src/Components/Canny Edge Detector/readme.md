Canny Edge Detector

The Canny Edge Detection algorithm is a widely used edge detection algorithm in todayâ€™s image processing applications. It works in multiple stages. Canny edge detection algorithm produces smoother, thinner, and cleaner images than Sobel and Prewitt filters.

Here is a summary of the canny edge detection algorithm

The input image is smoothened (1), Sobel filter is applied to detect the edges of the image(2). Then we apply non-max suppression(3) where the local maximum pixels in the gradient direction are retained, and the rest are suppressed. We apply thresholding (4) to remove pixels below a certain threshold and retain the pixels above a certain threshold to remove edges that could be formed due to noise. Later we apply hysteresis tracking (5) to make a pixel strong if any of the 8 neighboring pixels are strong.
